Close in-game GUI's using movement keys, so you can make a quick getaway!

## What does it do?

Are you like me? - Accidentally opening your inventory mid-battle, or panicking and forgetting how to close the chest GUI when you hear the hissing of a Creeper?
Then this mod is great for you!

Use W, A, S, D or Space to quickly close in-game GUI's.
It's made so that if a text field is focused, the GUI is not closed so you can still type stuff in the recipe book or creative menu for example.

Do you use other keys to move or just want to add other keys? Use the `closeonmove.json` file in your `config` folder, or use Mod Menu in the mod versions for Minecraft 1.20.3 and above.
